# Lottie Mac Player (WIP)
This repo contains a really basic form of a lottie player. Designers can use this application to test their lottie animations and make sure that what they design is fully supported. Currently this is a Work in Progress, meaning that not everything is fully implemented. Using it for a lottie player though is ready to go!

# Features
- Open Lottie json files
- Change the background color
- Add in background image
- Position animation on screen
- Resize canvas

# Future Work
Just some future work ideas in no particular order. There are some parts of the app that simply aren't implemented yet. This is a work in progress.

- Allow arrow keys to work with text fields (increment values)
- Be able to drag and drop animations
- Interact with views on the screen
- Position multiple animations on one viewport
